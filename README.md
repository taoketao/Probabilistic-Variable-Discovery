This is a class project for Stanford's Psych 204 (Probabilistic Cognition and Computation).  We use approximate inference methods in the probabilistic programming language, WebPPL, to model models themselves.  Using probability and data analysis techniques, we intend to improve existing models of various processes by examining each's fitness to the observed data.
